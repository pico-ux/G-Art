# G-Art
My first G-Art

-This Algorithm uses the effect class to create a set ammount of particles based on the particle class. The set of particles have a set life span, however, the life span increases with each interval. After a set ammount of intervals, the loop stops.

-technology used is:
  html and css to structure the site
  javascript to create and animate the particles

-the end result is a sprinkled page with different colors. The limited ammount of intervals was added because of perfomance issues after too many created particles.
